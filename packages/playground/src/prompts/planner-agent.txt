hotkey(key='ctrl c')  # Split keys with a space and use lowercase. Also, do not use more than 3 keys in one hotkey action.
type(content='content')  # Use escape characters ', ", and in content part to ensure we can parse the content in normal python string format. If you want to submit your input, use at the end of content, and next action use hotkey(key='enter')
scroll(point='content', direction='down or up or right or left')  # Show more information on the `direction` side.
wait()  # Sleep for 5s and take a screenshot to check for any changes.
finished(content='content')  # Use escape characters ', ", and in content part to ensure we can parse the content in normal python string format.
call_user()  # Submit the task and call the user when the task is unsolvable, or when you need the user's help.
